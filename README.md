## üì¶ Installation

**Important**: Before running any script from the internet, it's a good practice to inspect its content to understand what it does.

To install, clone the repository and run the script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Miladeos/zsh-setup.git && cd zsh-setup && chmod +x zshell.sh && ./zshell.sh -y
```

## üöÄ Usage

The `zshell.sh` script accepts the following command-line options:

-   `-h, --help`: Display the help message, showing available options and their descriptions.
-   `-y, --yes`: Skip all confirmation prompts and run in non-interactive mode. Useful for automated setups.
-   `-q, --quiet`: Minimal output. Only essential error messages and a final success or failure message will be displayed.
-   `-v, --verbose`: Show detailed output of all operations being performed. This is useful for debugging issues with the script.

**Examples:**

-   Run the script with default behavior (will prompt for confirmations):
    ```bash
    ./zshell.sh
    ```
-   Run in non-interactive mode (accept all defaults):
    ```bash
    ./zshell.sh -y
    ```
-   See all the steps the script is performing:
    ```bash
    ./zshell.sh -v
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Once the script has finished, your ZSH environment is ready to go, but you can further customize it to your liking:

-   **ZSH Configuration**: The main configuration file for ZSH is `~/.zshrc`. You can edit this file to change settings, add or remove plugins, modify aliases, and more.
-   **Powerlevel10k Theme**: To reconfigure the Powerlevel10k theme, run the command `p10k configure` in your terminal. This will guide you through the customization process, allowing you to change prompts, icons, and other visual aspects.
-   **Oh My ZSH Plugins**:
    -   To **add** a plugin, find its name (e.g., `newplugin`) and add it to the `plugins=(...)` list in your `~/.zshrc` file. For example: `plugins=(git docker newplugin)`
    -   To **remove** a plugin, simply delete its name from the `plugins=(...)` list in `~/.zshrc`.
    Remember to source your `~/.zshrc` file (e.g., by running `source ~/.zshrc`) or open a new terminal window for changes to take effect.
